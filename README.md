1.1 Balance: Displays the Bank balance.

1.2 Get a Loan Button:  Allows you to get a loan upon clicking on the button. 

You cannot get a loan greater than double your bank balance (e.g., if you have 500, you cannot get a loan greater than 1000).

You cannot get more than one bank loan before repaying the previous loan.

You may not have two loans simultaneously; the initial loan should be paid back in full.

1.2 Bank Button: Transfers the money from your Pay/Salary balance to your Bank balance. 

If you have an outstanding loan, 10% of your salary is deducted and transferred to the outstanding loan amount.
The remaining balance after the 10% deduction is transferred to your bank account.
